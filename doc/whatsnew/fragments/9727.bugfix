Fix a bug where a ``tox.ini`` file with pylint configuration was ignored and it exists in the current directory.

``.cfg`` and ``.ini`` files containing a ``Pylint`` configuration may now use a section named ``[pylint]``. This enhancement impacts the scenario where these file types are used as defaults when they are present and have not been explicitly referred to, using the ``--rcfile`` option.

Closes #9727
